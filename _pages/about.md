This is me up there ðŸ˜Ž. I am super interested in deep learning and blockchain. I absolutely love working with data and building deep learning algorithm to perform magic (at least that is what I call it ðŸ™‚). One of my greatest passion is creating tools that is helpful and meaningful to people. I work as a blockchain analyst in a startup. At my work place we develop tools that help in keeping the blockchain clean of bad entities that seek to give bad rep to this beautiful technology.

It is on this background I created this website to share my ideas and thoughts as well as tools that are necessary in analysing the blockchain.

Aside from software and data engineering, I am an avid traveller. I love to go to new places and experience different cultures. I hope the ideas here I will share with you become useful to you.

If you have any ideas or doubts on some of the opinions that maybe expressed here, kindly do not hesitate to reach out to me on twitter.
