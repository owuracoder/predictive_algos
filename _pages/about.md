This is me up there ðŸ˜Ž. I am super interested in deep learning and blockchain technology. I absolutely love working with data and building deep learning algorithm to perform magic (at least that is what I call it ðŸ™‚). One of my greatest passion is creating tools that is helpful and meaningful to people. I work as a blockchain analyst in a blockchain company. At my work place, we develop tools to monitor activities on the blockchain as well as deanonymising bad entities on the network.

I believe the work I do has so much impact on keeping the blockchain safe and streamling mainstream adoption of this technology. I created this blog to share my ideas and thoughts as well as tools that are necessary in analysing the blockchain.

Aside from software and data engineering, I am an prolific traveller. I love to go to new places and experience different cultures.

I hope the ideas and techniques I will share here will be an immense help to you.

If you have any ideas or doubts on some of the opinions that maybe expressed here, kindly do not hesitate to reach out to me on twitter.
