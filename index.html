This blog is dedicated to the harnessing of the power of deep learning for forensic analysis. On this page I will take you through a journey of building deep learning models for practical application in industry. I will spend enormous amount of time explaining the intricacies of training a model and putting it into production.

I will be sharing my thoughts and ideas in the form of explaining key technical terms as I build and deploy deep learning models. Most of the work I will share here will be inspired by **[fastai]("https://www.fast.ai/")**

In my opinion **[fastai]("https://www.fast.ai/")** is the best curriculum and the only resource on the internet I know of that teaches you deep learning and machine learning in general. The course also delves deep into best practices in software engineering. I am currently learning and developing applications with **[nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/)**
